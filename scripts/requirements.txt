# Python >= 3.8

# --- Development and Testing Dependencies ---
# It's often better to keep these in a separate file (e.g., requirements-dev.txt)
# but including here as per original file structure.
pytest>=6.0,<7.0 # Testing framework
pytest-cov>=2.10,<3.0 # Coverage reporting for pytest

# Note on Version Pinning:
# For development, unpinned versions (like above) are often okay.
# For production or reproducible environments, pin versions using '=='
# e.g., pandas==1.5.3
# You can generate a pinned list from your environment using:
# pip freeze > requirements_pinned.txt
