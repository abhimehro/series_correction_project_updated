click>=8.0 # For creating the command-line interface

# Specify Python version (Note: This is informational in requirements.txt,
# the actual enforcement happens in setup.py's python_requires)
# Python >= 3.8

# --- Development and Testing Dependencies ---
# It's often better to keep these in a separate file (e.g., requirements-dev.txt)
# but including here as per original file structure.
pytest>=6.0 # Testing framework
pytest-cov>=2.10 # Coverage reporting for pytest
pytest-mock>=3.0 # Fixture for mocking objects in tests

# Linters and Formatters (Optional but recommended)
black>=22.0 # Uncompromising code formatter
flake8>=4.0 # Linter for style guide enforcement (PEP 8)
pylint>=2.10 # Another powerful linter

# Note on Version Pinning:
# For development, unpinned versions (like above) are often okay.
# For production or reproducible environments, pin versions using '=='
# e.g., pandas==1.5.3
# You can generate a pinned list from your environment using:
# pip freeze > requirements_pinned.txt
