# Series Correction Project Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the Series Correction Project based on the requirements and
current implementation. The plan is organized by key areas of the system and includes rationale for each proposed
change. The goal is to enhance the project's functionality, reliability, performance, and usability while addressing
current limitations and preparing for future needs.

## 1. Core Processing Enhancements

### 1.1 Algorithm Refinements

**Current State:** The project implements basic algorithms for detecting and correcting gaps, jumps, and outliers in
time-series data. These algorithms use statistical methods within rolling windows.

**Proposed Changes:**

- Implement adaptive thresholding for outlier detection that adjusts based on data characteristics
- Add support for detecting and correcting drift in sensor data
- Enhance jump detection to better distinguish between legitimate changes and sensor errors
- Implement more sophisticated interpolation methods for gap filling (e.g., spline interpolation)

**Rationale:** These enhancements will improve the accuracy and reliability of the discontinuity detection and
correction process, particularly for complex datasets with varying characteristics. Adaptive thresholding will reduce
false positives in outlier detection, while drift correction will address a common issue in long-term sensor
deployments.

### 1.2 Performance Optimization

**Current State:** The current implementation processes data sequentially and may not be optimized for very large
datasets.

**Proposed Changes:**

- Profile the code to identify performance bottlenecks
- Optimize critical path algorithms for speed
- Implement parallel processing for batch operations where applicable
- Add memory usage optimization for large datasets

**Rationale:** These optimizations will improve processing speed and efficiency, particularly for large datasets or
batch processing operations. This addresses the performance requirements specified in the technical constraints.

## 2. Data Handling Improvements

### 2.1 Input Data Validation

**Current State:** Limited validation of input data format and content.

**Proposed Changes:**

- Implement comprehensive input data validation
- Add support for detecting and handling common data format issues
- Create a data quality pre-check step before processing
- Provide clear error messages for data format issues

**Rationale:** Enhanced validation will improve reliability by catching data issues early in the process, reducing
errors during processing, and providing clearer feedback to users about data quality issues.

### 2.2 Output Format Enhancements

**Current State:** Basic output in CSV format with limited metadata.

**Proposed Changes:**

- Add support for multiple output formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Include comprehensive metadata in output files
- Implement versioning for output files
- Create standardized naming conventions for output files

**Rationale:** These enhancements will improve the usability of the output data for downstream analysis and integration
with other systems, addressing the output requirements specified in the data constraints.

## 3. User Interface and Experience

### 3.1 Command-Line Interface Improvements

**Current State:** Basic CLI with limited options and feedback.

**Proposed Changes:**

- Enhance CLI with more intuitive commands and options
- Add progress indicators for long-running operations
- Implement interactive mode for configuration
- Provide more detailed help and examples

**Rationale:** These improvements will enhance usability, particularly for new users, and provide better feedback during
processing operations.

### 3.2 Visualization Implementation

**Current State:** No built-in visualization capabilities.

**Proposed Changes:**

- Implement a visualization module using Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Create functions to plot raw vs. corrected data
- Add visualization of detected discontinuities
- Implement interactive visualization options
- Add a `--plot` flag to the CLI

**Rationale:** Visualization capabilities will significantly improve the usability of the tool, allowing users to
visually inspect the corrections and better understand the data. This addresses the future requirement for visualization
capabilities.

## 4. Configuration and Extensibility

### 4.1 Configuration System Refactoring

**Current State:** Basic JSON configuration with limited validation.

**Proposed Changes:**

- Refactor configuration loading using Pydantic or dataclasses
- Implement configuration validation
- Add support for environment variables and command-line overrides
- Create configuration presets for common scenarios

**Rationale:** A more robust configuration system will improve reliability and usability, making it easier to configure
the tool for different datasets and use cases.

### 4.2 Plugin Architecture

**Current State:** Monolithic codebase with limited extensibility.

**Proposed Changes:**

- Design and implement a plugin architecture
- Create extension points for custom detection and correction algorithms
- Develop a mechanism for registering and loading plugins
- Document the plugin API for third-party developers

**Rationale:** A plugin architecture will enhance extensibility, allowing users to customize the tool for specific use
cases and datasets without modifying the core codebase.

## 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

### 5.1 Test Coverage Expansion

**Current State:** Limited unit tests with no integration or end-to-end tests.

**Proposed Changes:**

- Increase unit test coverage to at least 80%
- Implement integration tests for key workflows
- Create end-to-end tests using sample datasets
- Add performance benchmarks

**Rationale:** Comprehensive testing will improve reliability and make it easier to detect regressions when making
changes to the codebase.

### 5.2 Continuous Integration Enhancements

**Current State:** Basic CI setup with limited checks.

**Proposed Changes:**

- Enhance CI pipeline with more comprehensive checks
- Add code quality and style checks
- Implement automated performance testing
- Create deployment automation

**Rationale:** An enhanced CI pipeline will improve code quality and reliability, making it easier to maintain the
codebase and detect issues early.

## 6. Documentation and Training

### 6.1 Documentation Improvements

**Current State:** Basic README and methodology documentation.

**Proposed Changes:**

- Generate API reference documentation using Sphinx
- Create comprehensive user guides
- Add more examples and tutorials
- Implement documentation versioning

**Rationale:** Improved documentation will enhance usability, particularly for new users, and make it easier to
understand and use the tool effectively.

### 6.2 Training Materials

**Current State:** No formal training materials.

**Proposed Changes:**

- Create Jupyter notebooks with examples and explanations
- Develop video tutorials for common workflows
- Implement interactive tutorials within the tool
- Create a user forum or community platform

**Rationale:** Training materials will help users learn how to use the tool effectively, addressing the future
requirement for documentation and training.

## 7. Integration and Interoperability

### 7.1 API Development

**Current State:** No formal API for integration with other systems.

**Proposed Changes:**

- Design and implement a Python API for programmatic use
- Create a REST API for web integration
- Develop client libraries for common languages
- Document the API for third-party developers

**Rationale:** A well-designed API will enhance interoperability, allowing the tool to be integrated with other systems
and workflows.

### 7.2 NESST II Integration

**Current State:** No direct integration with NESST II.

**Proposed Changes:**

- Research NESST II integration requirements
- Implement data format converters for NESST II
- Create direct integration mechanisms
- Test and validate integration with NESST II
