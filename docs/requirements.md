# Series Correction Project Requirements

## Project Goals

1. **Automated Discontinuity Detection**
    - Automatically identify jumps, gaps, and outliers in time-series data from Seatek sensors
    - Provide configurable detection parameters to adjust sensitivity based on data characteristics
    - Support batch processing of multiple data files

2. **Reliable Correction Methods**
    - Implement interpolation methods for filling gaps in data
    - Develop offset correction techniques for jumps in baseline values
    - Create configurable outlier replacement strategies (median, mean, interpolation)
    - Ensure corrections maintain data integrity and physical meaning

3. **Usability and Accessibility**
    - Provide a command-line interface for easy execution
    - Support batch processing based on series, year range, and river mile criteria
    - Generate comprehensive reports and logs for transparency
    - Enable configuration through external files

4. **Data Quality and Validation**
    - Improve overall data quality for downstream analysis
    - Make data suitable for integration with systems like NESST II
    - Provide validation mechanisms to ensure processed data meets quality standards

## Technical Constraints

1. **Performance Requirements**
    - Process large datasets efficiently
    - Handle time-series data with potentially thousands of data points
    - Complete batch processing in reasonable time frames

2. **Compatibility Requirements**
    - Support Python 3.8 or higher
    - Work with space or tab-delimited input files
    - Generate output in standard formats (CSV, Excel)
    - Maintain compatibility with existing data analysis workflows

3. **Configurability Requirements**
    - Allow tuning of detection sensitivity (thresholds, window sizes)
    - Support selection of different correction methods
    - Enable specification of input/output directories
    - Provide river mile mapping configuration

4. **Reliability Requirements**
    - Handle edge cases gracefully
    - Provide detailed error reporting
    - Ensure reproducibility of results with the same configuration

## Data Constraints

1. **Input Data Format**
    - Files must follow the pattern `S<series>_Y<index>.txt`
    - Space or tab-delimited columns
    - Must contain at least a time column and one numeric sensor value column
    - Data should be roughly chronological

2. **Output Requirements**
    - Corrected data saved in CSV or Excel format
    - Summary reports with processing status and statistics
    - Detailed logs of processing steps and decisions

## Future Requirements

1. **Visualization Capabilities**
    - Implement visualization tools to plot raw vs. corrected data
    - Highlight detected discontinuities in visualizations
    - Support interactive exploration of data corrections

2. **Enhanced Validation**
    - Add more explicit data validation checks during loading
    - Implement range checking and anomaly detection
    - Provide confidence metrics for corrections

3. **Integration Capabilities**
    - Develop APIs for integration with other systems
    - Support direct integration with NESST II
    - Enable workflow automation for regular processing tasks

4. **Documentation and Training**
    - Provide comprehensive documentation for all features
    - Create tutorials and examples for common use cases
    - Develop training materials for new users
